**OVERALL DIAGNOSIS**  
Your Instagram Reel did not perform well due to a lack of viewer interest and engagement. Most viewers dropped off quickly, and very few took action by saving the content or interacting with it. It’s clear that the initial hook didn't grab attention.

**WHAT WENT WRONG**  
1. **Poor Retention (10.8% retention ratio)**: Only a small fraction of viewers stayed to watch the entire reel. This suggests that the content did not hold their interest or provide enough value to keep them engaged.  
2. **Weak Hook Strength (0.0/10)**: The opening line of your caption did not compel viewers to watch. Without a strong hook, people are likely to scroll past your content without engaging.  
3. **Low Engagement Rate (1.5%)**: With such a low engagement rate, it indicates that viewers were not motivated to like, comment, or share your reel. This lack of interaction means that your content is not resonating with your audience.

**YOUR TOP 3 ACTIONS**  
1. **Improve the Hook**: Start with a more captivating opening line that sparks curiosity or offers immediate value. For example, “Watch how I transformed this dull space into a stunning oasis in just 14 seconds!” This could increase your hook strength and retention.  
2. **Enhance Visual Appeal**: Make sure the visuals in your reel are eye-catching and dynamic. Use before-and-after shots or quick transitions to keep viewers engaged throughout the 14 seconds. This could help boost your retention rate.  
3. **Encourage Interaction**: Ask viewers a question in your caption, like “Which design element do you love the most?” This can help increase your engagement rate by inviting comments and conversations.

**WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE**  
Success on your next reel would mean a retention ratio above 30%, a hook strength of 7 or higher, and an engagement rate of at least 5%. You would see viewers watching your content until the end, actively liking and commenting, and even saving your work to revisit later. This indicates that your audience is not just watching but is genuinely interested in what you have to offer.
